# This is the README for knowde

How to use the new keyword-based reference system
----------------------------------------------------

Giving a knowde keywords is simple and doesn't need
further explanation. If you have organized your knowdes
in trees in a reasonable manner, sometimes theres no
need for keywords. But sometimes, information that is
best grouped together is divided into different branches
in the tree. Here you can give similar information
equal keywords and see how they relate in a) the keyword
tree view (click the "Toggle Tree View" to cycle through
the 3 views) and now also b) in the keyword reference
choice list which is located on the right side just above
the text field. If there is another knowde that is given
the same keyword, then there appears the keyword and below
the titles of knowdes referenced by. Clicking the knowde
titles takes you immediately to them to see the full
information.


Upgrading from 1.0.2 or earlier  to  1.1.1 or higher
----------------------------------------------------

There is an incompatibility in the structure of
knowde files because now there is no more distinction
between folders and knowdes - every knowde can be
folder of other knowdes or, seen from a different
perspective, folders can now contain data.

To load your old files into a newer version of knowde,
simply replace all strings "folder" in your xml file
with the string "knowde". That's all. Add the encoding
also, if it has changed or was not in UTF-8. Because
now with libxml2 and Gtk+-2.0, we have to work in UTF-8.

information.
