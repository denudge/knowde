"Help to use Knowde\n \
-------------------\n \
\n \
1. How to use the tree view:\n \
This is the default view on the knowde structure.\n \
Use the three buttons that display green knowde cards\n \
with the yellow star that means \"to create a new\".\n \
The first one creates a top knowde, the 2nd a sibling\n \
and the last one a child knowde of the currently selected\n \
knowde.\n \
\n \
2. How to use the keyword references:\n \
Simply create keywords per knowde. Knowdes that have same\n \
keywords are grouped together in the keyword tree view.\n \
You can cycle through the 3 views using the toggle button.\n \
On the right side just above the text, there is a quick\n \
reference link where the appropriate keywords and the\n \
titles of the knowdes that use them are displayed.\n \
Clicking on one of these takes you directly to the\n \
referenced knowde.\n \
\n \
3. If you have more questions or feature requests:\n \
Mail me. :-)\n \
